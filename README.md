# üîê Auth Flow Summary

- Users register or log in through Angular forms.

- HTTPClient sends credentials to Spring Boot endpoint.

- JWT is returned and stored in frontend.

- Route guard checks for JWT before allowing access to private pages.

# Route Guard

Even though the backend handles the real gatekeeping, adding role-based route guards on the frontend gives us:

- Early blocking: Prevents users from even seeing the page layout, loading components, or making unnecessary API calls.

- Cleaner UX: Shows relevant pages only. For example, job seekers won't accidentally stumble on employer pages and wonder what‚Äôs going on.

- Performance: Saves the app from fetching protected data just to get rejected later by the backend.

- Fail-safe: Defense in depth. If backend rules change or there's a bug, frontend guards act as an extra layer.
